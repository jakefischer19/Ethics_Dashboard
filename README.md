# Ethics_Dashboard

The Ethics Dashboard is a web application created as a capstone project for our COSC 224 Projects course. Our client is an Ethics professor at Okanagan College. She was looking for a tool that would assist her students
in evaluating case studies based on multiple ehtical methodologies.

The application was built using the LAMP stack. The front end was built using the Bootstrap as it's main design framework and basic Javascript for it's different functionalities.
We used a MySql database for the backend, along with PHP for database connection and data handling.

Due to the time constraints of a short semester and the large scope of the project, this application remains incomplete. However, we were able to complete a portion of the ethical
case analysis that our client was asking for. This is a fully functional portion of the application and our client was 100% satisfied with our work.
